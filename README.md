# KingOfAvalon-RPG
A text-based RPG game that I developed in high school with Java.

## Gameplay:
1) 


## Game Mechanics:
### Range-based Weapons
  - Player can select a Sword, Axe or Bow & Arrows. 
  - Weapons are only effective based on enemy spawn location (e.g An axe will not be able to damage an enemy that spawns far away from the Player)

### Weapon Forging
  - If the Player defeats an enemy, they have the option to pickup the enemy's weapon OR "forge/merge" their current weapon with the enemy weapon in order to create a "SUPER WEAPON"
  ⚠️ Forging weapons may be "unsuccessful" (both weapons are destroyed in the process) leaving the Player with NO WEAPON!
  
### Custom Player-Face
 - Players can also upload a self portrait and have their face super-imposed on the in-game character
