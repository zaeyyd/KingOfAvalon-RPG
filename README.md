# KingOfAvalon-RPG
A text-based RPG game that I developed in high school with Java.

## Game Mechanics:
### 1) Range-based Weapons
  - Player can select a Sword, Axe or Bow & Arrows. 
  - Weapons are only effective based on enemy spawn location (e.g An axe will not be able to damage an enemy that spawns far away from the Player)

### 2) Weapon Forging

Game mechanics included: 1) range based weapons e.g swords, bow & arrows,etc, 2) option to steal defeated enemy’s weapon, or take a “risk” and merge with current weapon which can result in either a successful upgraded “super weapon” or an unsuccessful combination that destroys both weapons, 3) option to take a selfie and have player’s face on in-game character
