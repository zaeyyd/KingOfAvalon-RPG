Game mechanics included: 1) range based weapons e.g swords, bow & arrows,etc, 2) option to steal defeated enemy’s weapon, or take a “risk” and merge with current weapon which can result in either a successful upgraded “super weapon” or an unsuccessful combination that destroys both weapons, 3) option to take a selfie and have player’s face on in-game character
