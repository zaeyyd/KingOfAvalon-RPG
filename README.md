# KingOfAvalon-RPG
A text-based RPG game that I developed in high school with Java.

## Game Mechanics:
### Range-based Weapons
  - Player can select a Sword, Axe or Bow & Arrows. 
  - Weapons are only effective based on enemy spawn location (e.g An axe will not be able to damage an enemy that spawns far away from the Player)

### Weapon Forging
  - If the Player defeats an enemy, they have the option to pickup the enemy's weapon OR "forge/merge" their current weapon with the enemy weapon in order to create a "SUPER WEAPON"
  ⚠️ Forging weapons may be "unsuccessful" (both weapons are destroyed in the process) leaving the Player with NO WEAPON!
  
### Custom Player-Face
 - Players can also upload a self portrait and have their face super-imposed on the in-game character

## Gameplay:
### 1) Beginning
  - Player starts game by selecting a weapon (Sword, Axe or Bow & Arrows). Player also starts game with randomly generated levels for Attack and Charisma 'Abilities'
### 2) Battles
  - Player can either use their weapon to "Attack" enemies, or they can use their Charisma Ability to "Charm" enemies in order to evade the situation
  - The Player's Attack or Charisma Level needs to be higher than the enemies' corresponding Ability in order to "WIN" a battle (If the Player Attacks and the enemy has higher "Attack Ability", Player will lose battle and health)
  - Player's "Ability Levels" increase as they use them (Successfully Attacking will increase your Attack Ability)
### 3) Levels
  - Player will go through a series of levels with "regular" enemies
  - Player will then reach a "Witch Level" where they will battle an Evil Witch. If the Evil Witch is successfully defeated, a mystery box will appear which can contain upgraded weapons or potions that the Player can use
  - Then the Player will face a FINAL BOSS DRAGON which they will need to defeat in order to 'free the kingdom' and win the game
